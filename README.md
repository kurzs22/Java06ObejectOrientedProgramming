# Java 06 Object Oriented Programming Quest

# Challenge
## Census of the Wild Code School!
You will create a class that represents your classmates as best as you can!

- Create a Wilder class.
- Adds the attributes String firstname and boolean present.
- Create a constructor to initialise firstname and present.
- Add getters and setters for all attributes, according to the conventions.
- Add a whoAmI() method that returns the text "My name is firstname and I am present" or "My name is firstname and I am not present", depending on the state of the attributes firstname and present.
- Create a Classroom class with a main() method.
- Add references to several instances of the Wilder class inside the main() method of Classroom.
- For each of the references, display the result of the whoAmI() method in the terminal.
- Compile and test Classroom: once everything is working perfectly, create a git repository and send it all to GitHub.
- Share the link to the GitHub repository as your solution.

Example of the expected result when running Classroom:

My name is Jean-Claude and I am present

My name is Henri and I'm not present

## Validation criterias
- Your GitHub repository contains the files Wilder.java and Classroom.java.
- The Wilder class follows OOP conventions: private attributes, using the keyword this, and contains appropriately named getters and setters.
- References to instances of the Wilder class are present within the Classroom class.
- The Classroom class compiles without throwing any errors and displays the expected result in the terminal.
